		</div>

		<p>When, therefore, Johannes Koelhoff of Lubeck, Germany,
		printed the “Cologne Chronicle” in 1499, he
		used individual movable cast-metal type. Typographic
		printing had long before superseded Xylographic printing,
		that is, printing from a solid block of wood on which type
		of an entire page were cut individually by hand.</p>

		<p>Between the invention of individual movable cast-metal
		type and the perfection by the Earl of Stanhope of
		his printing-press, (a period of about three hundred and
		sixty years), very few improvements had been made in
		the mechanics of printing. Everything we know today
		about the art has come into use since 1799, and if Koelhoff
		had come to life in 1799 and been permitted to
		resume his occupation of printer, he would have found
		himself practically familiar with the mechanical equipment
		<a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"> </a>of his craft as used in 
the establishment of the
		Stanhope Press in that last year of the eighteenth century.</p>

		<p>Centuries before 1440 printing is believed to have
		been attempted in China; presumably about the beginning
		of the Christian era. It is said that in the year
		A. D. 175 the text of the Chinese classics was cut into
		tablets which were erected outside the national university
		at Peking, and that impressions—probably rubbings—were
		taken of them. Some of these fac-simile impressions
		are still in existence, it is asserted.</p>

		<p>Xylography was also practiced in China long before
		Europe knew the art. It can be traced as far back as
		the sixth century, when the founder of the Suy dynasty
		is said to have had the remains of the Chinese classics
		engraved on wood, though it was not until the tenth
		century that printed books became common in China.</p>

		<p>The authorities of the British Museum also report
		that Chinese writers give the name of a certain Pi Sheng
		who, in the eleventh century, invented movable type,
		and the Department of Oriental Printed Books and
		Manuscripts of the same institution possesses a copy of
		the Wen hsien tung Kao, a Chinese encyclopedia printed
		in Korea from movable type in A. D. 1337.</p>

		<p>To the Koreans also is attributed the invention of
		copper type in the beginning of the 15th century, and
		the inspection of books bearing the dates of that period
		seems to show that they used such type, even if they
		did not invent them.</p>

		<p>The first authentic European printing produced from
		individual movable type of which we have any recorded
		impression, bears the date of A. D. 1454. These documents
		are two different editions of the same Letters of
		Indulgence issued in that year by Pope Nicholas V. in
		<a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"> </a>behalf of the Kingdom 
of Cyprus. We do not know,
		however, whether they were printed from metal or wood
		type.</p>

		<p><img class="figleft" src="images/fig1.png" width="242" 
height="383" alt="A monk at work." />As to the <em>exact</em> date of the 
invention of printing from
		individual movable type in Europe, we know only that
		it was some time prior to A. D.
		1454. Where and by whom the
		invention came about, a dispute
		has been waged for more than
		four hundred years; one of the
		most hotly contested questions
		in history. In short, Koelhoff
		was in part responsible for starting
		this dispute. He published
		in his “Cologne Chronicle” a
		statement by Ulrich Zell, a
		printer of Mainz in Germany and
		a contemporary of Gutenberg,
		that Gutenberg <em>had improved</em>,
		but <em>not invented</em> the art, which he attributes to Coster
		of Haarlem, in the Netherlands, in the year 1440. Gutenberg
		stole Coster’s type, according to Zell, and printed
		from them in 1442. Other unrefutable evidence shows
		that Gutenberg could not have begun printing at Mainz
		before the end of 1450.</p>

		<p>In addition to Gutenberg and Coster we also find
		Waldfoghel of Avignon, in France, and Castaldi of Felte,
		in Italy, mentioned as claimants of this invention. The
		value of their respective pretensions has been summed up
		by one well known authority in the words, “Holland has
		books, but no documents. France has documents, but
		no books. Italy has neither books, nor documents,
		while Germany has both books and documents.”
		<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"> </a>
		As the case stands at present, after careful and impartial
		examination of all available evidence, no choice
		is left but to attribute the invention of printing with
		individual movable cast-metal type to Lourens Janszoon
		Coster of Haarlem in the Netherlands between the
		years 1440 and 1446 and not to Gutenberg of Mainz in
		Germany.</p>

		<p>Zell’s statement in the “Cologne Chronicle” of 1499 is
		further substantiated by Hadrianus Junius in his “Batavia.”
		Junius stated that printing from individual movable
		type was invented by Coster in Haarlem, and that
		the “Speculum Humanae Salvationes” was one of his
		first productions. These two statements were made
		independently of each other and both are corroborated
		by books to which they refer.</p>

		<p>The “Speculum Humanae Salvationes,” attributed to
		Coster by Junius was partly a folio Latin block-book,
		and partly typographically printed. From this and
		other records it has been clearly established that Coster
		began as a xylographer and ended as a typographical
		printer, and before 1472 he had manufactured and extensively
		used at least seven different styles of primitive
		looking individual movable cast-metal type.</p>

		<p>According to tradition, while he was walking in a wood
		near Haarlem, Coster cut some letters in the bark of a
		beech tree, and with them, reversely impressed one by
		one on paper, he composed one or two lines as an example
		for the children of his son-in-law.</p>

		<p>Junius does not say it, but clearly implies that, in this
		way, Coster came to the idea of the movability of the
		characters, the first step in the invention of typography.
		He perceived the advantage and utility of such insulated
		characters, which hitherto he had been cutting together
		<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"> </a>on one block, and so 
the invention of printing with
		individual movable type was made.</p>

		<p>The questions as to whether he continued to print
		with movable “wooden” type, or even printed books
		with them, cannot be answered, because no such books
		or fragments of them have come down to us. Junius’
		words on this point are ambiguous, and yet, upon the
		examination of the first edition of the Dutch Spiegel (of
		which two copies are preserved at Haarlem) no one would
		deny that there are grounds for this belief. The dancing
		condition of the lines and letters make it almost impossible
		to think that they are impressions from metal type.
		But for how long and to what extent movable wooden
		type were employed, if at all, cannot be positively
		stated.</p>

		<p>However, this idea of movability, and the accidental
		way in which it was discovered, form together the pith
		of the Haarlem tradition as told by Junius. Nothing
		seems more natural than that a block-printer should cut
		such separate letters as Coster did on the bark of a tree
		and thereupon perceive that they could be used over and
		over again for a variety of words on different pages,
		while those which he used to cut in a solid block only
		served him for one page and for one purpose.</p>

		<p>It is equally clear from the Haarlem tradition that the
		art of casting metal type was the second stage in the
		invention, a development or outcome of the primary
		idea of “movable letters,” for Junius says that Coster
		“afterwards changed the beechen characters into leaden,
		and the latter again into tin ones.”</p>

		<p>Theod. Bibliander, in 1548, was the first to speak of
		movable wooden type and to describe them. First they
		cut their letters, he reports, on wood blocks the size of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"> </a>an entire page; but 
because the labor and cost of that
		way was so great, they devised movable wooden type,
		perforated and joined one to another by a thread.</p>

		<p>Bibliander does not say that he had ever seen such
		type himself, but Dan Speckle or Specklin (d. 1589) who
		ascribed the invention to Mentelin, asserts that he saw
		some of these wooden type at Straussburg; and Angelo
		Roccho asserted in 1591 that he had seen at Venice type
		perforated and joined one to another by a thread, but
		he does not state whether they were of wood or of metal.</p>

		<p>There is a theory also that between block-printing and
		printing with movable cast-metal type there was an
		intermediate stage of printing with “sculpto-fusi”
		type; that is, a type of which the shank had to be cast
		in a quadrilateral mold and the characters or letters
		engraved afterwards by hand. This theory was suggested
		by some one who could not believe in wooden
		type and yet wished to account for the marked irregularities
		of the type used to print the earliest books.</p>

		<p>Granting that all the earlier works of typography preserved
		to us are impressions of cast-metal type, there are
		still differences of opinion, especially among practical
		printers and type-founders, as to the probable methods
		employed to cast them. It is considered unlikely, although
		not impossible, that the invention of printing
		passed all at once from xylography to the perfect typography
		of the punch, matrix, and mold.</p>

		<p>The types that Coster made and used were supposed
		to have been manufactured in one of three or four probable
		ways.</p>

		<p>Bernard believed that the first movable cast-metal
		type were molded in sand, since that method of casting
		was known to the silversmiths and trinket-makers of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"> </a>the fifteenth 
century. In substantiation of his theory he
		exhibits a specimen of a word cast as a unit for him by
		this process, roughly similar to a modern linotype slug.</p>

		<p>A second suggested mode was that of casting in clay
		molds, by a method very similar to that used in the
		sand process, and resulting in like peculiarities and
		variations in the type.</p>

		<p>Ottley, in his “Invention of Printing,” was the chief
		exponent of this theory. He believed that type were
		made by pouring molten lead into
		molds of clay or plaster, after the
		ordinary manner used from time
		immemorial in casting statues and
		other articles of metal.</p>

		<p><img class="figleft" src="images/fig2.png" width="207" 
height="313" alt="A workman with a brayer" />The imperfections in the type
		cast by the sand and clay processes—the
		difficulty of uneven
		heights in the various type—is
		supposed to have been surmounted
		either by locking up the form with
		the type-face downward on the
		composing stone, or by perforating the type, either at
		the time of casting or afterwards, and holding them
		in their places by means of a wire or thread through
		the perforations.</p>

		<p>To this cause has been attributed the numerous misprints
		in those early specimens of the printers’ art, to
		correct which would have involved the unthreading of
		every line in which a typographical error occurred.</p>

		<p>A striking proof that the lines were put into the form
		one by one, as a piece, instead of type by type, is shown
		in a blunder in the “Speculum” of Coster where the
		whole of a last reference line is “turned.” It is as if a
		<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"> </a>modern linotype slug 
were put in the form up-side-down.</p>

		<p>A third suggestion as to the method by which the type
		of those early days of printing may have been produced
		is described as a system that the type-founders of about
		1800 called Polytypage, which is a cast facsimile copy
		of an engraved block of type matter. Lambinet, who is
		responsible for this suggestion, explains that this method
		really means an early adoption of the stereotyping
		process.</p>

		<p>Lambinet thought that the early printers may have
		discovered a way of molding in cooling metal so as to
		get a matrix-plate impression of an entire page. Upon
		this matrix they would pour molten lead or tin and by
		the aid of a roller, press the fused metal evenly so as to
		make it penetrate into all the hollows and corners of the
		letters. This tablet of lead or tin, when cooled, being
		easily detached from the matrix, would then reveal the
		letters of the alphabet reversed and in relief, similar to
		a present day stereotype. The individual letters, of
		course, could easily be cut apart by a sharp tool, and
		the molding operation could be repeated, using the
		same matrix. The metal type faces so produced would
		be fixed on wooden shanks, type high, and the font
		would be complete.</p>

		<p>It is impossible to suppose, however, that the Mainz
		psalter of 1457, which Lambinet points to as a specimen
		of this mode of execution, is the impression, not of type
		at all, but a collection of “casts” mounted on wood.</p>

		<p>Yet another theory has been proposed by Dr. Ch.
		Enschede, head of the celebrated type foundry of that
		name in Haarlem. Enschede concludes that the Costerian
		type were produced from leaden matrices and the
		latter from brass patrices. Their bad, irregular condition
		<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"> </a>was due to the tools 
being imperfect, and Coster in
		the first practice of his invention was inexperienced and
		therefore bound to produce such imperfections as are
		found in the Speculum. Coster’s type were cast in one
		tempo, that is, the character itself and the shank cast
		at the same time in one piece.</p>

		<p>Gutenberg’s patrices, according to Enschede, were
		made like bookbinders’ stamps, of yellow copper, i. e.,
		brass. With such patrices only lead matrices could be
		made, but the latter could be produced in two ways.
		Molten lead could be poured over the patrices or the
		patrices could be pressed into cold lead. The first mode
		is somewhat complex, but the matrix would have a
		smooth surface and need no further adjustment.</p>

		<p>The second mode is more simple, but required great
		force, although lead is a soft metal. Moreover the surface
		of the matrix would have to be trimmed, as the
		impression forces the metal downwards and sidewards,
		which makes the surface uneven, though by this pressure
		the lead becomes firmer and more compact, to the
		advantage of the type-founder.</p>

		<p>Enschede thinks that Gutenberg obtained his matrices
		by the second mode. He arrives at this conclusion
		by reason of the fact that Gutenberg’s types were sharper
		in their impressions than Coster’s. Developing this
		theory, he believes that Gutenberg had each letter engraved
		on a brass plate 2 mm. thick, therefore a mere
		letter without anything underneath it. This brass letter
		patrix was pressed, by means of a small flat plate, so
		far into the lead that its back formed an unbroken plane
		with the top surface of the lead, and was then removed.</p>

		<p>After the matrix had been made this way, the type
		were cast, which was done, not by pouring metal into
		<a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"> </a>the matrix, but by 
pressing the latter into semi-fused
		metal. In this way a great many letters could be cast
		from one matrix without any injury to it. Gutenberg’s
		method was to cast in two tempos, according to Enschede,
		that is, the character was cast first and the shank was
		cast by another operation joining it to the character.</p>

		<p>Enschede warns us, however, that his theories are
		simply those of a practical founder and not a bibliographer’s.
		But since no tools used by those early
		printers and type-founders have come to light to prove
		or disprove him, his theory is as valuable as any others
		advanced as to the methods used for casting type in
		those primitive days of printing.</p>

		<p>The shape of the type used as early as 1470 does not
		seem to differ materially from those of the present day.
		This is evident from old type which were discovered in
		1878 in the bed of the river Saone, near Lyons, opposite
		the site of one of the fifteenth century printing-houses
		of that city.</p>

		<p>Also a page in Joh. Neider’s “Lepra Moralis” printed
		by Conrad Homburch in Cologne in 1476 shows the
		accidental impression of a type pulled up from its
		place in the course of printing by the ink-ball, and laid
		at length on the face of the form, leaving its exact profile
		indented upon the page.</p>

		<p>This accidental imprint shows a small circle, and it is
		presumed that the type were pierced latterly by a
		circular hole, which did not penetrate the whole thickness
		of the letter, and served, like the nick in modern
		type, to enable the compositor to tell by touch which way
		to set the letter in his stick.</p>

		<p>The fact that a letter was pulled out of the form seems
		to show that the type composing the line could not have
		<a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"> </a>been threaded 
together, as set forth by Ottley in his
		theory of clay molds for casting type. It is to be
		remembered, however, that in the early days of printing,
		every printer was his own type-founder. The method
		of casting type had not been standardized and each
		printer had his own individual ideas both as to the kind
		of characters and the method used in casting them.
		Some may have threaded their type together in lines
		and others may have simply locked them up in the form
		face downward in the composing stone to overcome any
		irregularities caused by crude methods of casting.</p>

		<p>Vinc. Fineschi, of Florence, in Italy, gives an extract
		from the cost-book of the Ripoli press, about 1480, which
		shows that steel, brass, copper, tin, lead and iron were
		all used in the manufacture of type at that period.</p>

		<p>Today we have the wizardry of mechanical production
		in the manufacture of type. The linotype and
		monotype machines, uncanny in their operations, have
		also come into common practice. Without them printing
		would seem almost as primitive, in typography, as
		it was in its infancy.</p>

			<h2>STEREOTYPING</h2>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<img class="init" src="images/init-a.png" width="96" 
height="100" alt="A" />
			<p class="init"><span class="first_word">About</span> the 
beginning of the eighteenth
			century a certain Van der Meyer, of
			Antwerp, made the next step towards a
			definite improvement in typography, the
			first that had been attempted since the
			invention of printing from movable,
			cast-metal type. Van der Meyer prepared the composed
			pages of the Bible by soldering together the bottom of
			the type in the form. This was the first “stereotype,”
			a term derived from two Greek words meaning literally
			“solidtype.”</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>This method met one requirement. It prevented the
		“pi-ing” of the type, but it had the disadvantage of
		holding in comparative idleness a large and costly mass
		of type useless for any other purpose, and it was not
		generally practiced.</p>

		<p>This was followed in 1730, by William Ged, a goldsmith
		of Edinburgh, who is credited with casting printing-plates
		in plaster-of-paris molds for the University
		of Cambridge Bible. These plates, however, were destroyed
		by jealous printers and thrown aside, resulting
		in the process being abandoned for many years.</p>

		<p>In the meantime several other improvements along
		this line were undergoing experiment. Firmin Didot,
		(1764-1836), a printer of Paris, cast type of a hard
		<a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"> </a>alloy, and when his 
book-pages were composed, made an
		impression of them on a sheet of soft lead, thus forming
		a mold. Molten metal was then poured into a shallow
		tray, and just as this was on the point of solidifying, but
		still plastic, the lead-mold of the book-page was pressed
		on the soft metal in the tray. This process called Polytypage,
		was but partly successful; it could be used only
		for small pages, and the plates were too often defective.
		A process similar to this is what Lambinet thought the
		printers of the latter half of the fifteenth century might
		have used as one of the probable methods to cast their
		metal types.</p>

		<p>These and other experiments, however, were leading
		to the real stereotyping process which developed later.</p>

		<p>Early in the nineteenth century, Earl Stanhope, of
		England, re-introduced Ged’s stereotyping process with
		many improvements.</p>

		<p>One or more pages of type were locked in a chase, the
		surface of the type being oiled to prevent the subsequent
		mold from sticking. The mold was made by pouring
		a semi-fluid composition of plaster-of-paris mixed with
		a little fine salt to make the plaster settle solidly. While
		the plaster was still soft, it was carefully pressed down
		and rolled smooth on top to give a uniform thickness to
		the mold and to expel any air there might be in the
		plaster. When the plaster became solid, it formed a
		perfect matrix of the type pages.</p>

		<p>The moisture in those early plaster molds was expelled
		by baking them in an oven for three or four
		hours. A later method for drying was practiced by
		suspending the mold directly over the metal-pots or to
		float them on the surface of the molten metal. By this
		<a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"> </a>means the drying 
could be accomplished in a half-hour
		or so.</p>

		<p>In the process of casting, several of these plaster
		molds were placed side by side face downward in a
		special casting-pan. The pan was one and three-quarters
		or two inches deep, and a lid on the pan screwed down on
		the back of the molds. By means of a crane the casting
		pan with its molds was then lowered into the pot of
		molten metal which ran into the
		pan at the corners and sides.
		The mold was allowed to remain
		ten minutes or so in the
		metal-pot, or until the face of
		the inverted mold was entirely
		filled with the metal.</p>
		
		<p><img class="figleft" src="images/fig3.png" width="228" 
height="310" alt="A man pours from a ladle." />A later method of casting from
		a plaster mold was to place it in
		a frame with a smooth, flat plate
		opposite the face of the mold and
		to enclose the open space at one
		end and on the two sides. The casting space thus formed
		was then turned with the open end up and metal was
		poured in with a ladle, in a manner similar to the method
		still employed for casting job-work stereotypes. The
		distance between the flat plate and the mold was
		adjusted to make a stereotype plate of the required
		thickness.</p>
		
		<p>After the removal and cooling of the casting pan, the
		plates were freed from the plaster and the surplus metal
		cut off. Only one cast could be made, as the mold was
		usually destroyed in removing the cast. The stereotype
		was then sent to the finishing department, where the
		<a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"> </a>face was cleaned and 
examined for defective letters, then
		trimmed on the sides and planed off uniformly on the
		back to the desired thickness, in the same manner as a
		stereotype is treated today. A defective letter could be
		mortised out of the plate and a good type inserted in its
		place. In cases where a whole line or other part was
		imperfect, another mold was made of as much of the
		form as was necessary and the new cast inserted and
		soldered to the plate.</p>

		<p>There were many and varied experiments made in the
		earlier development of this idea of producing a duplicate
		printing form in a single piece. That such a process was
		highly desirable was universally recognized, and the
		conviction that some practicable and economical method
		was feasible was a continual incentive which gradually
		led to better results.</p>

			<p class="init"><span class="first_word">The</span> papier-
mache (literally, mashed paper)
			matrix was first successfully used
			for casting stereotypes for book pages
			in France in 1848. Charles Craske, an
			engraver of New York, introduced the
			method into the stereotype trade of the
			United States in 1850, and in 1854 he stereotyped a page
			of the “<cite>New York Herald</cite>” and later made 
stereotypes
			for other New York newspapers.</p>
		</div>
		<p>The modern wet stereotype “flong,” in common use
		today, consists of several layers of special paper pasted
		together to form a thick sheet. The base is a sheet of
		special soft stock similar to firm blotting-paper, such as
		is used between leaves of small blank books. Three or
		four sheets of strong, white tissue are next added, each
		sheet except the last being uniformly covered with the
		paste. The pasting must be done with great care so as
		to cover the entire surface of each sheet and at the same
		time to press out all air bubbles. The sheets must then
		be pressed smoothly but not squeezed so hard as to force
		the paste out and must be kept moist until used. In
		newspaper syndicate plants, the “flong” is made automatically
		by a specially devised machine into which the
		various kinds of paper used are fed from rolls, the
		pasting and cutting into sheets being mechanical.</p>

		<p>In molding a papier-mache matrix, the moist “flong”
		is laid on the original molding form to be duplicated,
		the molding form being in place on the table of the
		molding press. The “flong” is covered with several
		blankets of thick felt and the table of the molding press
		<a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24"> </a>is then automatically 
moved in under a powerful roller
		which squeezes the moist flong down into the form. At
		the end of its travel the table is automatically brought
		back again under the rollers to the position from which
		it started. The speed of the roller and the table is
		synchronized to obviate any possibility of the mat
		becoming wrinkled by sliding.</p>

		<p>The molded matrix and the pattern with the blanket
		still on it is then transferred to the drying press, in which
		under a hot platten it is again squeezed and allowed to
		remain for a few minutes until the moisture is completely
		expelled from the molded flong. The drying press is
		kept at a high temperature, usually by steam heat.</p>

		<p>The matrix thus dried out to a thick, flexible cardboard
		is then ready for the casting of the stereotype,
		which is done by pouring molten stereotype metal against
		the face of the matrix placed in a casting-box designed
		for this purpose. A successive number of stereotypes
		can be cast for the same mat before it is injured by the
		hot metal. For job-work stereotyping the casting-box
		is flat, and the molten metal is either poured by hand or
		automatically pumped in the casting-box.</p>

		<p>After the stereotype is cast it is flattened, rough
		shaved, smooth shaved, bevelled or blocked on wood;
		the wood base trimmed and then planed type-high for
		printing press use.</p>

		<p>The large daily papers cast the full-page stereotype
		from which the paper is printed in an automatic casting
		machine which forms a curved plate, trimmed and
		bevelled, to fit the cylinder of the press.</p>

		<p>Stereotyping was for many years the chief means of
		making plates for books and also for commercial printing.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"> </a>It has several 
advantages. The first, obviously, is the
		advantage which it shares with several other methods of
		providing a solid printing plate made by molding from
		an original form of type or engraving. Its peculiar
		advantage, however, is that it is the quickest method of
		producing a duplicate plate from an original.</p>

		<p>In comparison with electrotyping, however, it has
		two distinct disadvantages. One is that it is not adapted
		for reproducing the fine lines of engravings and type
		faces. In addition it is comparatively shallow and does
		not possess a sharp, clean printing face. The other disadvantage
		is that a stereotype is relatively soft and
		quickly worn.</p>

		<p>Stereotypes have been made more durable, to withstand
		the wear of printing, by the deposition of a film of
		harder metal—copper or nickel—on the face of the
		plate after it has been cast. This, however, is not
		satisfactory, as it involves not only another operation,
		but also makes an already shallow printing plate that
		much shallower and increases the probability of it printing
		“dirty,” which is one of the chief objections to the
		stereotype in itself. This practice is not recommended.</p>

			<h2>ELECTROTYPING</h2>
		</div>

		<div>
			<img class="init" src="images/init-i.png" width="98" 
height="100" alt="I" />
			<p class="init"><span class="first_word">In</span> 1799, 
Allesandro Volta, of Pavia, in
				Italy, constructed the first electric battery,
				which came to be called the Voltaic
				pile. Improvements in the form of
				Volta’s battery were made almost immediately
				by William Cruickshank, in England,
				who discovered in experimenting with it that he
				could by its power electrolyze or chemically decompose
				the salts of certain metals in solution. Both copper and
				silver, he found, could be precipitated from their salt
				solutions and deposited upon a plate immersed in the
				solution.</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>This observation was the first step in the process of
		electroplating, which is electrotyping when applied to the
		art of typography.</p>

		<p>In 1837, thirty-eight years after Volta’s discovery, Mr.
		Thomas Spencer of Liverpool, England, accidentally
		stumbled upon the first realization of the electrotyping
		process.</p>

		<p>While experimenting with a modification of a Daniell
		battery, he used an English copper penny as one of the
		poles instead of a plain piece of copper. A deposition of
		copper from the solution in the battery took place upon
		the penny, and upon removing the wire which attached
		<a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"> </a>the penny to the zinc 
plate a portion of the copper
		deposit was pulled off the penny also.</p>

		<p>This first copper electrotype shell Spencer found to be
		an exact duplicate or mold of part of the head and
		lettering on the coin. <em>It was as smooth and as sharp
		as the original.</em></p>

		<p>It was some time later, however, before this suggested
		to him any useful application of the process. Another
		accident made him appreciate the full value of his
		discovery. This time he carelessly dropped some varnish
		on a strip of copper which he was going to use in the same
		way he did the penny. Upon removing the copper from
		the battery he observed that there was no deposition of
		copper on those parts of the strip where the varnish had
		dropped.</p>

		<p>Spencer then conceived the idea of applying this
		principle to the arts by coating a piece of copper with
		varnish or wax and engraving a design in the coating,
		thus exposing the copper strip in the engraved lines.
		He did this, and then deposited copper in the design so
		engraved. Upon removing the coating the design was
		exposed in relief on the piece of copper.</p>

		<p>On September 13, 1839, Spencer read a paper before
		the Polytechnic Institution of Liverpool, which he accompanied
		with specimens of both electrotypes made by this
		process and of printing from these electrotypes. The
		publication of this paper acted like an electric shock upon
		society.</p>

		<p>Developing his process, Spencer first used lead as the
		plastic medium in which to mold printing surfaces, and
		it is to be noted in this connection that in doing so he
		anticipated Dr. Albert’s lead mold by considerably
		over three quarters of a century.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"> </a>
		Spencer impressed a form of type on a planed piece of
		sheet-lead and subjected both of them to the action of
		a screw-press. A perfectly sharp mold of the type
		form was thus made in the lead. This lead mold was
		placed in a battery, and at the end of <em>eight days</em> a
		copper shell one eighth of an inch in thickness had been
		deposited. <img class="figleft" src="images/fig5.png" width="248" 
height="358" alt="A man holds a beaker of liquid." />It was then removed
		from the apparatus and the
		rough edge of the deposited
		copper filed off. Being subjected
		to heat, the copper shell
		loosened from the lead-mold.
		Spencer called this a “copper
		stereotype.”</p>

		<p>The next step in developing
		the electrotyping process, after
		Spencer had demonstrated the
		practical application of the
		electro-chemical deposition of
		a copper shell on a mold, was
		made by a Mr. Robert Murray. Mr. Murray was
		the first to use plumbago, or black-lead, to give the
		surface of non-metallic bodies electro-conductive
		properties. He discovered that he could coat a mold of
		bees-wax with black-lead and deposit thereon a copper
		shell. This was in 1840.</p>

		<p>In the same year Smee’s battery was invented. This
		was a marked improvement and was a most important
		step towards making electrotyping a commercial possibility.</p>

		<p>Thus in 1840, four hundred years after the probable
		date of the invention of printing from individual
		movable cast-metal type, and over forty years after
		<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"> </a>the foundation of 
electrotyping was laid by Volta,
		electrotyping, as a practical method of reproducing a
		commercial typographical printing surface, came into
		existence.</p>

		<p>Mr. E. Palmer, in England, using Spencer’s method,
		was the first to receive a patent for producing a metallic
		printing plate with the printing surfaces in relief. This
		patent is dated 1841. Palmer followed this in the
		succeeding year by a further patent for engraving through
		a wax-coated matrix-plate to form the printing surfaces
		in the <em>positive</em> electrotype taken from it. This process
		was termed by Palmer, “Glyphography.”</p>

		<p>The “whites” or low spots in Palmer’s Glyphographs
		were “built-up” in the wax mold through adding wax
		by hand, assisted by various ingeniously constructed
		tools which were heated. After “building-up,” the wax
		was black-leaded and the copper deposition on the
		surface of the wax mold was obtained. This copper
		deposit, or shell, was then tinned on the back, backed up
		with lead, mounted on wood, and trimmed type-high.
		These processes are the essentials used today in electrotyping.</p>

		<p>One of the earliest works illustrated by the Palmer
		process is “The History and Antiquities of Brentford,
		Ealing, and Chiswick,” by T. Faulkner, published in
		1845, and the word “Glyphography” occurs at the foot
		of many illustrations contained in it.</p>

		<p>In 1839 the first attempt was made at commercial
		electrotyping in America. In that year, Joseph A.
		Adams, a wood-engraver connected with Harper &amp; Bros.
		in New York, experimented along lines similar to those
		Spencer had pursued, but using a wood-cut from which to
		mold. His electrotypes were made by taking an impression
		<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"> </a>from the wood-cut in 
an alloy of soft metal of
		which bismuth was probably the chief ingredient, and
		immersing the metal mold in an ordinary Voltaic
		battery for the deposition of the copper shell. In making
		the impression, however, the wood-cut was destroyed so,
		that this method of making an electrotype was not
		commercially practical.</p>

		<p><img class="figright" src="images/fig6.png" width="237" 
height="367" alt="A man operates a screw press" />The year following Adams
		took advantage of Smee’s battery
		and made an electrotype
		which was used in Mape’s Magazine
		in 1841. He also employed
		this process for making
		illustrations for Harper’s Family
		Bible, issued between 1842 and
		1844.</p>

		<p>The first successful commercial
		electrotyper in America was
		John W. Wilcox, of Boston. A
		wood carver named Chandler,
		told Mr. Wilcox that if he could repeat what Adams
		of New York had done with a wood-cut in 1839 that
		he, Chandler, would lend him the necessary wood-cuts
		for experimental purposes. In less than sixty days
		in 1846, Mr. Wilcox had put into practical use every
		essential principle known for the next twenty-five years
		in electrotyping.</p>

		<p>In 1855, Mr. Gay of New York first used tin-foil for
		the purpose of soldering the copper shells to the metal
		backing.</p>

		<p>During the same year, a Mr. Adams of Brooklyn,
		New York, invented the dry-brush black-leading machine.</p>

		<p>Steven D. Tucker, of New York, developed and
		<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"> </a>patented in 1866 the 
type of dry-brush black-leading
		machine which is in common use today.</p>

		<p>In 1871, Silas P. Knight, of Harper &amp; Bros., New York,
		invented the wet black-leading process, and in 1872 took
		out another patent for an improvement on this process.
		Mr. Knight’s method of wet black-leading was not
		generally adopted by the electrotypers of that time and
		gradually became almost unknown.</p>

		<p>Undoubtedly, the cause of this was that the method of
		dry black-leading was good enough for type and woodcut
		work. The half-tone had not been invented at that
		time, and it was only after the invention of the half-tone
		that a better method of black-leading became necessary.</p>

		<p>Thirty-seven years after Mr. Knight had successfully
		used his process of wet black-leading a patent was
		granted to Frank L. Learman, of Buffalo, New York, for
		a wet black-leader. Since that time numerous patents
		have been taken out on different methods of using the
		wet process, which is universally recognized today as the
		best method of graphiting the surface of a mold.</p>

		<p>In 1870, Joseph A. Adams patented a process for covering
		the surface of the mold after it had been black-leaded
		with powdered tin. This was for the purpose of
		quickening the deposition of the copper shell when the
		molds were in the batteries, and from this undoubtedly
		came the oxidizing process of coating the surface of the
		molds with chemical copper invented by Silas Knight,
		which has long been and is now in use.</p>

		<p>Perhaps one of the greatest forward steps in the
		development of electrotyping was made when the plating
		dynamo was invented. The first adoption of a dynamo
		in place of Smee’s battery took place in 1872. With the
		Smee type of battery it required from thirty to forty-eight
		<a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33"> </a>hours to deposit a 
copper shell thick enough for
		commercial use. With the invention of the plating
		dynamo and its improvements, the time of depositing the
		shell was reduced so that now two hours is the common
		time that a mold is kept in the tubs or batteries. This
		quickening of the time required to deposit the shell was
		one of the most essential features in the development of
		commercial electrotyping.</p>

		<p>From the first hand-screw presses, which were successfully
		used for molding, to the modern high-power,
		motor-driven, hydraulic presses, for working either in
		wax or lead, is a far cry.</p>

		<p>The invention of the half-tone, together with the
		invention of the modern two-revolution cylinder press
		which has brought printing into its present state of
		perfection, made necessary radical improvements in the
		machinery for making electrotypes. These improvements
		have been steady in their development, but the
		fundamental points of the process are practically those
		which have been in use from the start of commercial
		electrotyping.</p>

		operations are necessary to make a finished electrotype
		ready for the press. They may be enumerated, as
		follows:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><span class="li_title">Case-making.</span> The flowing of 
a molding compound composed of &#8220;ozokerite,&#8221; a resinol-mineral wax, 
onto the case. The case is of copper.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Flashing the Case.</span> Passing a 
flame over the <a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36">&nbsp;</a>surface of 
the melted ozokerite immediately after flowing the case in order to remove air-
bubbles.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Case-shaving.</span> The automatic 
shaving of the top surface of the flowed case after the ozokerite has hardened 
to give it a smooth, even surface for molding.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Graphiting.</span> Brushing surface 
of case with molding graphite to prevent the pattern from sticking to the wax 
mold.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Molding.</span> Making an 
impression from the original zinc line etching, half-tone or type form in the 
waxed case. This is done by means of a hydraulically operated molding 
press.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Cutting-down.</span> The levelling 
off by hand, using a sharp trowel shaped tool, of the splurge after the 
impression has been made. Flashing is also used here to remove the burr left 
around the letters after the cutting down process.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Building-up.</span> The adding of 
wax by hand to the blank spaces in the molded case so that in the finished 
electrotype they will be well below the printing face.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Black-leading.</span> Making the 
face of the molded case electrically conductive by applying graphite.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Stopping-out.</span> Insulating 
with a thin coating of wax the edges and back of the copper case to prevent 
copper being deposited except on the face of the mold.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Pumping-out or Oxidizing.</span> 
Coating the face of the molded case with chemical copper to hasten deposition of 
copper shell in the bath.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Deposition of Shell.</span> The 
molded case is put in the electrolytic bath for the deposition of shell 
thereon.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Releasing Shell from Molds.</span> 
Stripping the deposited shell from the waxed mold by dashing hot <a 
class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37">&nbsp;</a>water on it. The wax is melted 
off case and used again.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Washing Copper Shell.</span> Hot 
lye-water or steam is used to clean off any wax sticking to it.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Trimming Copper Shell.</span> Rough 
edges of shell outside the guard line trimmed off.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Aciding Copper Shell.</span> An 
application of fluxing medium to back of copper shell so that tin will 
adhere.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Tinning Copper Shell.</span> Tin-
foil is melted on the back of the copper shell. This is the solder between the 
copper shell and the metal back, without which the metal backing would not 
adhere to the shell.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Backing-up.</span> The flowing of 
electrotype metal on the back of the tinned copper shell for the purpose of 
making a foundation for printing (electrotype metal is an alloy of 94 per cent 
lead; 3 per cent tin for flowing and 3 per cent antimony for hardness).</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Scrubbing the Cast.</span> A power 
operated scrubbing machine using a hydro-carbon oil as the cleansing medium to 
clean the printing face of the electrotypes.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Cast-sawing.</span> Sawing off the 
surplus metal of the cast before finishing.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Flattening the Casts.</span> Hand 
operation with mallet and flattening block to take the warp out of the 
electrotype caused by the contraction of the metal in cooling.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Rough-shaving.</span> Planing off 
superfluous metal from the back of the electrotype.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Finishing.</span> Putting the 
printing surface of the electrotype in perfect condition for press after leaving 
the foundry department. This is done by hand and requires a high degree of 
skill.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title"><a class="pagenum" id="page38" 
title="38">&nbsp;</a>Smooth-shaving.</span> The finishing shave of metal from 
back of electrotype to bring it to the required thickness.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Routing.</span> Cutting out the 
high but non-printing surfaces of the electrotype by a routing machine.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Guard-line Sawing.</span> Cutting 
the guard lines or bearers off the electrotype to practically the finished size 
before blocking or bevelling.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Blocking.</span> Fastening the 
plate on wood base with brads driven through the metal.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Trimming.</span> Trimming the wood 
mounted electrotype to its exact finished size.</li>
			<li><span class="li_title">Type-high Machining.</span> Used 
for planing the bottom of the wood base so that the mounted electrotype is of 
printing press requirements, i. e., .918″ high.</li>

			<img class="init" src="images/init-t.png" width="106" 
height="100" alt="T" />
			<p class="init"><span class="first_word">The</span> age long 
progress in the development
			and perfection of typographical printing
			surfaces, from the period of Xylographic
			blocks on through the successive inventions
			of individual movable cast-metal
			type, stereotyping and electrotyping, by
			both the wax and lead-molding processes, reaches its
			culmination in <em>Aluminotypes</em>.</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Briefly, it is a method of casting printing plates of
		aluminum alloy in molds made from a composition of
		plaster-of-paris. In its essential points it is a modern
		adaptation of the process credited to William Ged of
		Edinburgh in 1730 and afterwards modified and improved
		in the early 19th century by Earl Stanhope of England.</p>

		<p>In practice, the original to be duplicated is placed on
		a molding-slab. A molding frame is set upon the slab
		and enclosing the original. A special kind of oil is
		then sprayed on the face of the original. This is to
		facilitate the release of the plaster mold so that it will
		not “tear” when it is ready to be lifted off the original
		after solidifying, and at the same time to retain the
		sharpness of the mold.</p>

		<p>The molding medium of plaster composition in a
		semi-liquefied state is then poured on to the original in
		the molding frame. The surplus plaster is scraped off
		flush with the top of the molding frame.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42"> </a>
		After the plaster matrix in its molding frame has set
		sufficiently it is released by means of cams from the
		working pattern on the molding-slab.</p>

		<p>The plaster matrix is then placed in a drying oven,
		through which a forced draft of hot air is kept circulating
		at high pressure. The thorough drying of the mold
		takes approximately ninety minutes.</p>

		<p>When the plaster mold has become sufficiently dried,
		a round hole is cut through the bottom of the matrix in
		an offset of the molding frame. This hole is the gate
		through which the molten aluminum is forced. The
		mold is then securely locked upright in a specially
		designed casting machine.</p>

		<p>The Aluminotype is cast by pressure and not by
		pouring as in the case of stereotypes, which depend
		entirely upon gravity. Fused aluminum alloy is poured
		into a hopper on the casting machine. A piston operated
		by the agency of compressed air forces the aluminum
		evenly into all parts of the plaster matrix.</p>

		<p>When the cast is completed the molding frame is
		taken from the casting machine and the Aluminotype
		removed from its plaster-of-paris matrix.</p>

		<p class="subhead">SOME ADVERTISING PICTURES PRINT WELL—OTHERS
		DO NOT. WHY? IT’S ALL A MATTER
		OF GOING ABOUT IT IN A KNOW-HOW WAY</p>
		
		<p class="byline">By J. LIVINGSTON LARNED</p>
		
		<div>
			<img class="init" src="images/init-a.png" width="96" 
height="100" alt="A" />
			<p class="init"><span class="first_word">An</span> advertiser—
perhaps one of the largest
			users of newspaper space in the country—sprang
			a surprise recently on his ad-manager.
			Into the office he came, one
			day, grim-visaged, jaw set, fire in his
			eyes, and armed with no less than fifty
			clippings from exchanges.</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>And on the amazed ad-manager’s desk he placed two
		conglomerate piles of advertising matter. One represented
		the national newspaper campaign of his own
		industry; the other a collection of newspaper advertisements,
		picked at random.</p>

		<p>“I think I have conclusive proof,” said he, in no mild
		mood, “that you fellows are not as efficient as you might
		be. Here are our advertisements—from papers everywhere.
		The illustrations print abominably! Look at
		them. The matter has been called to my attention
		many times—by the newspapers themselves, by our
		road representatives and by local dealers. They say
		our electro service and our straight national campaigns
		<a class="pagenum" id="page44" title="44"> </a>are all muddied up 
with pictures that nobody can
		decipher. Here’s conclusive proof of it. Not a clean-looking
		cut in the series and you can’t blame it on paper
		and press work and all that—they’re <em>all</em> bad!”</p>

		<p>The advertising manager glanced casually at the
		exhibits. The criticism was valid. Here was a daily
		newspaper campaign, running into space valued at
		approximately sixty thousand dollars, and the displays,
		three-fourths illustration, were mussy, involved, smeared
		up, and unsatisfactory from a reproductive standpoint.
		Solid black backgrounds were a sickly, washed-out gray
		and in other places intricate pen work had “run-together.”</p>

		<p>It was equally true that clippings of competitive
		advertising and advertising in general, selected at random,
		were strangely clean-cut. The comparison was
		startling.</p>

		<p>“Mr. X,” finally observed the ad-manager, “I see what
		you mean; all of us in this department have known of it,
		kept track of it; and the remarkable part of the entire
		situation is that these results can be traced back to you
		and your personal insistence on a certain type of pen
		and ink design, executed in a specific technique. These
		matters came up for your supervision and O. K. You
		did not care for the bold, simple outline drawings first
		submitted. You preferred too many, and a glut of
		detail. All of which is not compatible with newspaper
		printing, even in large space. We were afraid of this
		and said so at the time. Our objection was overruled.
		It’s one thing to prefer a pleasing, perhaps highly
		artistic pen technique and quite another to apply it to
		fast presses, poor ink and hurried make-ready. A great
		many things can happen, and <em>do</em> happen, to a newspaper
		design before it is printed and in the readers’ hands.”</p>

		<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45"> </a>DISREGARDING 
FUNDAMENTALS</h3>

		<p>Sometimes it is better to come out with the frank,
		brutal truth. In a great many instances, poor newspaper
		reproduction is the direct result of some executive’s
		marked preference for a certain artist or a certain
		technique, regardless of whether the man is qualified to
		draw for this field, or whether the technique is fitted for
		the purpose.</p>

		<p>On the other hand, there is, unquestionably, a strange,
		well nigh inexcusable disregard of certain fundamentals
		of the business. There is too much swivel-chair composure;
		too much beatific reassurance, when proofs are
		submitted on good paper, from a flat-bed engraver-house
		press. A newspaper series is very apt to look
		100 per cent when presented on the final electro sheet, or
		bound into a neat booklet for the dealer and printed on
		coated stock. These are ostrich methods!</p>

		<p>In certain advertising agencies there is a standing
		rule in the matter of newspaper plates that all proofs
		must be pulled on newspaper stock—and a very inferior
		grade. A newspaper press is used, an entire series coming
		off at once. There is no make-ready to speak of.</p>

		<p>By this process no one is deceived. You see exactly
		what will happen, or nearly so, when the series fares
		forth to newspapers all over the country.</p>

		<p>The executive mentioned above had collected newspapers,
		big and little, from the four points of the compass.
		And he had collected a liberal number of perfectly satisfactory
		newspaper advertisements of the illustrated
		variety. Blacks were clean black, Ben Day tints held
		their own, there was no congestion, no smudging, no
		mishap of any sort.</p>

		<p>If certain rules are followed, any newspaper advertising
		<a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46"> </a>illustration can be 
made “fool-proof.” You can be
		absolutely certain of a printable result, despite all
		exigencies, all drawbacks, all hazards.</p>

		<p>Failure usually follows a desire to attempt something
		beyond that which has been tried and is wholly practical.
		For the present, at least, users of newspaper space <em>must</em>
		bow to the inevitable. They <em>must</em> realize that there
		is a well-defined limit to what can be done mechanically.
		They must <em>not</em> defiantly experiment, although the desire
		to “do something new” and to be original is entirely
		praiseworthy.</p>

		<h3>THINGS YOU CAN’T DO</h3>

		<p>If you use half-tones, have them made very coarse
		screen—nothing finer than 60 line. Stop out whites and
		eliminate backgrounds. The high-light half-tone is a
		modern development with many virtues. If a portrait
		is used, take out all background.</p>

		<p>There is a way of retouching photographs that will
		minimize the danger of poor printing. The artist
		strengthens weak contrasts, not with a brush and paint,
		but with a pen and waterproof black ink. He also uses
		areas of pure white. Successful reproduction is dependent
		upon <em>sharp</em>, clear, vigorous <em>contrasts</em>.</p>

		<p>Stippling is one of the best substitutes for the half-tone.
		This simply means dotting-in a subject. It is a time-consuming,
		laborious process, but it means line plates
		and the elimination of middle tones—which are disastrous.</p>

		<p>There was a time when certain clever inventions of the
		paper manufacturer could be employed for half-tone
		effects in line. For example, a Ross Board is manufactured
		with an assortment of patterned surfaces.
		When brush or crayon or pencil is drawn over them,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47"> </a>they give effects 
that may not be duplicated in straight
		pen and ink on plain white drawing board. Some of
		these papers have a chalk surface. Some have imitation
		half-tone patterns, straight-line designs, etc. It is possible
		to scratch away certain portions with a sharp knife.
		<em>Do not use them</em> as matters now stand in newspaper
		printing. They will not “stand reduction” and only
		very coarse tints reproduce satisfactorily.</p>

		<p><em>Special Caution</em>—Do not allow artists to make
		original drawings for newspaper use much larger than
		twice the size. Here is one of the greatest evils of the
		day. The artist seems possessed to make his original
		on a full sheet of paper, when he knows that the plate is
		for two or three newspaper columns. What happens?
		An illustration which makes a handsome showing in the
		original will inevitably fill-in when reduced to “actual
		size.” Figure it out yourself—look at it through a
		reducing glass. Lines that seem wide apart almost
		touch in the congestion that follows great reduction.
		The really wise and shrewd artist makes his newspaper
		drawing <em>actual</em> size.</p>

		<p>Not more than a dozen Ben Day patterns can be used
		safely—now—in newspapers. Do you know the meaning
		of “Ben Day?” It is a mechanical tint, printed
		mechanically either on the plate, by the engraver, or on
		the original drawing, from an inked gelatine surface and
		rubbed on with a stilus. Magazine reproduction accepts
		it in all its forms. Newspaper stock muddies it up when
		it is too fine. In any event, when selecting a pattern,
		see that it is an open one and have it put on the engraving—not
		the design. If on the design it means a reduction.
		If on the plate it means no reduction, but precisely as
		shown in the Ben Day book of patterns.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page48" title="48"> </a>
		Avoid complex line treatments and techniques, such
		as cross-hatching and the laying in of many very fine
		290 pen lines close together. They look well in the
		original—they seldom print well on newspaper stock.
		They reduce abominably.</p>

		<p>Any newspaper illustration should have plenty of
		white margin to “relieve it.” When a drawing is
		cramped, packed in, suffocated by side rules, borders and
		text, it suffers.</p>

		<p>Clear outline drawings, with an occasional dash of
		black, prove most efficient for newspaper reproduction.
		They <em>can’t</em> fill in, they <em>can’t</em> smudge, they 
<em>can’t</em> become
		contaminated by clots of printing ink or defects in the
		newspaper stock. Not even fast press work can damage
		their printability. But remember, not all outline drawings
		are alike—great originality of technique can be
		secured.</p>

		<h3>CAREFUL OF BLACK AREAS</h3>

		<p>Large areas of solid black are not advisable. Think
		it over. Ink flows irregularly on newspaper presses.
		One copy may show up exactly as in the original; the
		next may develop a white halo, a gray tendency, a
		smeary, half-baked look. No two impressions will be
		quite the same. And it is logical to see that this is apt
		to be so. Any imperfection or irregularity in the ink
		roller will cause it, or the collection of foreign matter on
		cut or roller. Any black area larger than two inches
		square is a hazard.</p>

		<p>Advertisers often think that masses of solid black will
		make an advertisement “stand out.” They would if
		they printed a smooth, even black—which they seldom
		do. But liberal white margins are far more potent in
		<a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49"> </a>attracting attention 
and in segregating an advertisement
		from mixed company than solid blacks.</p>

		<p>The <em>appearance</em> of large areas of black may be
		secured via subterfuge. One method is to form the
		background of heavy black lines, quite close together.
		The white spaces between save the printing. Look at
		straight type through a magnifying glass. Not even
		type is printed clear black. Then what chance would an
		even surface of large proportion have?</p>

		<p>Newspaper cuts should be “routed deep.” Routing is
		merely the deepening or entire cutting away of extraneous
		matter on the engraving—that is, where there
		is no printing surface. The smudges of hideous design
		often seen are really an impression of a metal surface
		that has not been routed out properly. Every engraving
		should be examined critically for such defects.</p>

		<p>Avoid placing a shaded area against a black area. As
		we have intimated, the heart and soul of the successful
		newspaper drawing is <em>contrast</em>.</p>

		<p>The beginning of every advertisement or series of
		advertisements is represented in terms of a first visualization.
		It is in pencil. These should be made same
		size—that is, the actual size they are to eventually
		appear. Then no one, the artist least of all, is fooled by
		disparity of proportions.</p>

		<h3>KEEP IT SIMPLE</h3>

		<p>The visualizer should keep one cardinal point in mind.
		Keep newspaper advertisements simple. The less there
		is in them the better. Thirty-two of the ads selected by
		our advertising friend, mentioned earlier in the story,
		were good because they were simple. Type was held to
		blocks, and with as little change in style, size and
		character of type as possible.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50"> </a>
		All of them were characterized by liberal white margins.
		It is the best known way of fighting back the opposition
		of the surrounding appeals on the same page.</p>

		<p>There’s a good test possible. Make a photographic
		print of your advertisement, the size it is to appear, and
		paste it on a newspaper page—not a New York or
		Chicago paper, but a page in the “Bingville Banner.”</p>

		<p>Before plates are made or even before pen and ink
		drawings are fully completed, you can change, rearrange,
		eliminate, or add to, as the case may be.</p>

		<p>The wise advertiser is the one who in preparing an
		elaborate and extensive newspaper campaign keys it in
		its printing qualities, not to the best papers on the list,
		but to the ones that are worst printed. This may mean
		the undreamed of thing of 100 per cent perfect!</p>

		<p>No advertiser can hope to secure full efficiency from
		a campaign if it presents a smudged and confused
		appearance. Newspapers are trig things in their own
		right. Their column rules and their precision of type
		make this an arbitrary condition. There is really nothing
		finer and cleaner and more pleasing to the human
		eye than a well-composed newspaper, hot from the press.
		Ugly advertisements can make an ugly newspaper. They
		can even spoil the set-up and typography in general of
		the reading sections.</p>

		<p>A newspaper is held responsible if returns from a
		single advertisement or a campaign are not satisfactory.
		It is looked upon as a “poor medium.” Yet how many
		times the true fault can be traced to the message itself.
		Full efficiency in advertising is the result of full efficiency
		in the copy *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.</p>

		<p>Your ad-plate is locked into the form with the other
		matter composing the page. A hurried lock-up, and the
		form is molded into a mat and stereotyped. Fast
		presses and cheap ink do the rest.</p>

		<p>If your ad does not show up well in the first few
		impressions run off, the press grinds on just the same,
		with little or no make-ready. Once they start, it is
		too late to stop to allow the press-room foreman to
		investigate why a certain ad does not print up well.
		The “Daily Bugle” must get on the streets, if possible,
		before its competitors with the important scoop that the
		Beghum of Swat has just died. If you have supplied the
		best material for the newspapers to work with, the clean-cut
		reproduction of your advertisement is insured. If
		you have been penny-wise and pound-foolish in saving
		a few cents on your ad-plate, all the dollars you spent on
		art, typography and white space for your ad are on the
		knees of the gods and liable to be spilled off the said
		<a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52"> </a>knees, and your ad is 
messy looking when it appears.
		The advertiser invariably blames the newspaper and
		the newspaper passes the buck on to the plate-maker.
		The printed appearance of the ad is largely determined
		by the kind of plate furnished to the newspaper.</p>

		<p>The large daily newspapers are entirely dependent
		upon the stereotyping process for the necessary speed
		required in production. They do not print directly from
		type or cuts. The big advantage of stereotyping in this
		connection lies in the fact that it is the quickest method
		of producing a solid, duplicate printing plate from an
		original molding form. After locking up a page form,
		it can be molded, the matrix dried and the plate cast
		and ready for the press in about ten minutes.</p>

		<p>Therefore, only unmounted plates should be sent to
		the large daily papers and not wood mounted, as it takes
		too long for the heat to pass through the wood base in
		drying the mat.</p>

		<p>The unmounted plate is placed on a metal base,
		(because heat passes through metal quickly in drying
		the mat) and then locked in the form with the type and
		other matter composing the entire page. A mat is then
		molded from the complete form and a curved stereotype
		is cast from this page mat. It is from this curved full
		page stereotype that the large daily newspaper is actually
		printed.</p>

		<p>Since they must duplicate the plates sent to them by
		the stereotyping process, your expensively prepared
		advertisement, if it is to appear sharp and clean in the
		valuable space it uses, should be electrotyped by your
		plate-maker. A stereotype duplicated from an electrotype
		will print cleaner than a stereotype duplicated from
		a stereotype by reason of the fact that mats molded by
		<a class="pagenum" id="page53" title="53"> </a>the newspaper from 
electrotypes are sharper and deeper
		than when they are molded from stereotypes.</p>

		<p>Electrotypes have a distinctly sharper and harder face
		and are deeper than stereotypes. The very nature of
		the process and materials used in their manufacture
		makes this superiority inevitable. Wax is used as the
		plastic medium in which to mold electrotypes, whereas
		for stereotypes paper is used. Sharpness and depth
		cannot be molded into paper as it can into wax.</p>

		<p>Neither will stereotype metal poured by gravity against
		a paper matrix mold be as sharp and deep as copper
		deposited electrolytically on a wax mold.</p>

		<p>It follows, therefore, that when an unmounted electrotype
		is supplied to the “Chicago Tribune” or the
		“New York Journal” or the “San Francisco Call”
		they are stereotyping your ad in the page form from a
		plate molded in wax directly from the original.</p>

		<p>On the other hand, when you supply a stereotype of
		your ad to the large dailies this stereotype is already
		one step removed from the original master plate and
		means that two paper mats intervene between the
		original supplied to the plate-maker and the final stereotype
		of the page containing your advertisement. In
		short, they are duplicating a stereotype from a stereotype
		and each duplication means a loss in sharpness and
		depth; therefore they should be supplied with a sharp
		electrotype from which to make their final page mat.</p>

		<p>Obviously when a stereotype is supplied to the large
		dailies they are working from a plate that is neither
		sharp nor deep to start with, as would be the case if you
		sent them an electrotype from which to work. An
		electrotype is economy in the end and will save you
		grief, when the cost of space is considered.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page54" title="54"> </a>
		Should you desire economy, order your plate-maker
		to send mats—copy considered—to the large dailies. A
		mat is less expensive than a stereotype and will reproduce
		your advertisement equally as well.</p>

		<p>When you send them a mat instead of an electro there
		is one more duplication for the newspapers to make in
		producing the final stereotype from which they print,
		but the mat which your plate-maker furnishes them is
		at least molded directly from the original plate, so that
		it is sharper and deeper than the mat the newspapers
		have to make when you furnish them a stereotype from
		which to work. When you furnish the large dailies with
		the mat they cast a flat stereotype first, which is locked
		up in the form with the other matter composing the
		page. This entire form is then molded into a mat and
		stereotyped.</p>

		<p>The small dailies and country newspapers print directly
		from type and cuts. They use a flat-bed press. For this
		reason it is necessary that the advertising-plate or
		dealers cut which you furnish to them should be mounted
		type-high.</p>

		<p>The best plate you can furnish them is none too good;
		their make-ready and the general handling of their
		material is not of the highest order in efficiency as compared
		to the large dailies, and it is entirely probable
		that even with a good sharp electrotype, your advertisement
		may not show to advantage. With a stereotype,
		the liability of smudgy printing is greatly enhanced.</p>

		<p>The Rapid Electrotype Company knows the mechanical
		equipment of the different newspapers throughout
		the United States. It sends mounted plates to those
		papers that print directly from type and cuts, and
		unmounted plates to those that stereotype their forms.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page55" title="55"> </a>This detail is left 
entirely to their discretion. The names
		of the towns to which your advertisement or dealers-cut
		is to be shipped is all the information they require in
		order to determine whether or not to ship mounted or
		unmounted plates.</p>

Company</span>
			of Cincinnati was organized in

			in service over a fifth of a century.</p>
		</div>

		<p>Prior to the organization of The Rapid
		Electrotype Company, electrotyping was, on the whole,
		a localized business. The Rapid Electrotype Company
		pioneered in the service of making and distributing newspaper
		advertising plates—electrotypes, aluminotypes,
		stereotypes, and mats—direct from its factory in Cincinnati
		to newspapers and dealers throughout the United
		States.</p>

		<p>The originality of this service, intelligently rendered to
		advertising agencies and advertisers, was one of the
		reasons for the increase of their capacity from only
		five thousand square inches of plate matter daily in 1899
		to one million square inches per day in 1921, and from an
		organization of only nine men to one of over two hundred
		and fifty, working in day and night shifts.</p>

		<p>Their new factory is unquestionably the largest of its
		kind in the world, especially designed and equipped for
		the making and distribution of newspaper ad plates of
		all kinds. Over forty-five thousand square feet of floor
		space is devoted to this service, and with their highly
		<a class="pagenum" id="page58" title="58"> </a>developed co-
operative facilities they occupy a unique
		place in the advertising plans of many large national
		advertisers and advertising agencies.</p>

		<h3>FACTORY PRACTICE</h3>

		<p>Developing and serving an ever increasing volume of
		business has brought about a specialization in the factory
		practice of The Rapid Electrotype Company. It has
		kept pace with the demands upon its production and
		has made improvements in manufacturing methods
		designed to cut-corners in cost of manufacture, to be
		shared with its customers, and to make its service truly
		Rapid for all emergencies, without sacrificing quality.</p>

		<p>Its commercial job-plate department is a separate
		and distinct unit from the newspaper advertising-plate
		department.</p>

		<p>The character of the respective requirements of
		commercial job-plates and newspaper advertising plates
		make this departmental production advisable.</p>

		<p>A lead-molding press, built by The F. Wesel Mfg.
		Co., weighing over thirty-thousand pounds, and developing
		two thousand tons pressure per square inch on a
		thirty inch hydraulically operated ram is used in the
		job-plate department. On this press are duplicated, from
		the finest screen half-tones, the highest quality electrotypes
		and nickeltypes to be used in three and four color
		process printing.</p>

		<p>The preponderating volume of its business, however,
		is the production of newspaper electrotypes, and it is in
		this department that The Rapid Electrotype Company
		has made distinct improvements in manufacturing practice
		by methods and machinery designed and constructed
		by its own engineers in its own machine shop.</p>

		<h3><a class="pagenum" id="page59" title="59"> </a>BLACK 
LEADING</h3>

		<p>The Rapid Electrotype Company has built a new
		type of machine for use in this important phase of the
		electrotyping art. It is a combination Dry-Wet Machine,
		designed by its own engineering staff.</p>

		<p>Those familiar with electrotypes well know the superiority
		of the wet black leading process, especially for
		half-tones, stipple, Ben Day or fine type, where much of
		the detail and sharpness is lost in dry black leading,
		because of the crushing effect the brushes have on the
		wax mold. In this new type of black leading machine
		this fault is entirely eliminated, as the brushes never
		come in contact with the printing face of the mold;
		they merely polish the high built-up spots, thereby insuring
		better electrical conductivity to the wax, and
		a more uniform deposition of the copper shell.</p>

		<p>Two of these especially designed machines are in
		constant operation in the ad department, which means
		the highest grade of advertising plates.</p>

		<h3>DEPOSITING THE SHELL</h3>

		<p>Those who are not technically familiar with electrochemistry
		are prone to think that the length of time a
		mold is kept in the electrolytic bath, i. e., the copper
		bath, determines the thickness of the shell deposited
		thereon. As a matter of fact, one electrotyper may keep
		his molds in the copper bath for three hours and get
		only as thick a shell as another who keeps his in but two
		hours. The element of time does not determine the
		thickness nor quality of the shell deposited.</p>

		<p>The determining factors in this phase of electrotyping
		are the composition of the electrolytic bath, its temperature,
		and the current density applied. In addition,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page60" title="60"> </a>the purity of the 
materials, the cleanliness of the batteries,
		the perfection of the electrical connections as well as
		the distance between the anode and the cathode are all
		matters of importance. These factors are all variables
		and must be confined between narrow limits.</p>

		<p>This important phase of manufacture in The Rapid
		Electrotype Company is under the supervision of an
		electro-chemical engineer.</p>

		<p>Plus this fact is the accuracy of mechanical operation
		in handling wax molds from the time they are put into
		the batteries until they are taken out with the shell
		deposited thereon and ready for tinning and backing-up.</p>

		<p>The molded cases are suspended at regular intervals
		of twenty inches from an endless chain-conveyor operating
		directly over the batteries. This conveyor carries the
		cases edge-wise through the electrolytic bath between two
		rows of anodes which are four inches apart. At the end
		of each battery the conveyor automatically lifts the
		cases out and over into the next battery in the series, of
		which there are seven. The eighth tub contains pure
		running water for washing the case after the complete
		deposition of the shell.</p>

		<p>The speed of this conveyor is regulated so that when
		the molded case has reached the end of its journey
		through the series of seven batteries, the other factors
		also being regulated, a shell of uniform thickness and
		texture throughout is deposited thereon.</p>

		<p>This automatic handling of the cases in the batteries
		eliminates the necessity of the battery-man pulling the
		case out of the bath by hand from time to time in order
		to peel back a corner of the shell to see if it is thick
		enough, which is the common practice. In other words,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page61" title="61"> </a>the element of human 
guess-work is eliminated, and in
		addition, the items of time and handling are greatly
		reduced.</p>

		<h3>BACKING UP THE SHELL</h3>

		<p>Backing-up the shells with the metal base, i. e., casting,
		is done automatically by The Rapid Electrotype Company.</p>

		<p>A rotary casting-table with a capacity of ten pans
		revolves around its axis on a plane that brings each pan
		immediately below a spout through which the required
		metal is automatically flowed from the bottom of the
		metal pot on the tinned shell placed therein. When the
		required metal backing has been flowed, the table turns
		to bring the next pan with its shell under the metal-spout.
		The amount of metal flowed is exactly regulated.
		As the casting table completes a circuit, the first shell
		backed up has cooled so that it can be removed to the
		scrubbing machine.</p>

		<p>This method, of course, eliminates the hand-ladling of
		hot metal from the metal-pot to the casting-table, as is
		the ordinary practice, and obviates any possibility of the
		oxidized metal or dross on the surface getting into the
		casts, besides effecting a marked economy in time and
		handling. In addition, it casts the plates flat, thereby
		eliminating about 75 per cent of the finishing, which, of
		course, means a better printing plate. Three of these
		machines are used.</p>

		<p>The Rapid Electrotype Company developed and built
		these casting-machines in its own machine shop and owns
		the patents covering them.</p>

		<h3>THE ALUMINOTYPE PROCESS</h3>

		<p>The development, perfection and introduction of the
		Aluminotype Process for duplicating a printing surface
		<a class="pagenum" id="page62" title="62"> </a>in a solid piece is 
one of the outstanding accomplishments
		of The Rapid Electrotype Company, and marks a distinct
		step in advance of the other and older methods used in
		the graphic arts, for certain classes of printing.</p>

		<p>Aluminotypes are much harder than an electrotype or
		stereotype and have as sharp and deep a printing face as
		an electrotype. The Aluminotype process will reproduce
		as sharp and clear as the electrotyping process an eighty
		line screen half-tone, which is really too fine a screen for
		newspaper printing.</p>

		<p>A distinct advantage Aluminotypes have is in the
		item of weight. An Aluminotype, unmounted, weighs
		only one quarter as much as an unmounted electrotype
		or stereotype of the same size. When mounted on a
		wood base an Aluminotype weighs just one half as much
		as an electrotype or stereotype of the same size mounted
		on wood. In a national advertising campaign where a
		general list of newspapers is used Aluminotypes, by
		reason of their light weight, effect a marked saving in
		parcel-post or express charges. This saving in postage
		is especially noticeable in the case of foreign country
		newspaper campaigns.</p>

		<p>In addition, because of their toughness, a saving can
		be made in packing Aluminotypes, inasmuch as they do
		not require the expensive precautions in packing to avoid
		injury in transportation that electrotypes or stereotypes
		do. They will not bend; their printing face cannot be
		injured by the ordinary mishaps attendant upon handling
		in transportation. For all practical purposes it can be
		said that Aluminotypes are indestructible.</p>

		<h3>MATRICES</h3>

		<p>The ordinary practice followed in making mats is to
		use an electrotype or stereotype pattern plate made
		<a class="pagenum" id="page63" title="63"> </a>from the original 
form. Sometimes the original itself
		is used.</p>

		<p>The first mat molded from an electrotype pattern
		plate will be sharp. The next one molded will be a
		little less sharp than the first. The third one molded
		will be slightly less sharp than the second one. In other
		words, with every succeeding mold, the electrotype or
		stereotype pattern plate is mashed a little by the pressure
		of the matrix press until it has to be discarded and a new
		one used.</p>

		<p>The five-thousandth mat made by the Rapid Electrotype
		Company from the same pattern plate is as sharp
		as the first one molded. This is because an <em>aluminotype</em>
		pattern is used from which to mold. <em>Aluminotypes</em>
		will not mash under the pressure of the matrix
		press, as they are much harder than electrotypes.</p>

		<h3>THE SHIPPING DEPARTMENT</h3>

		<p>The shipping department of The Rapid Electrotype
		Company is one of the most important and highly
		systematized in the entire organization, and in the
		manner of handling orders for distribution to newspapers
		in large campaigns or in making bulk shipment direct to
		the advertisers is unique.</p>

		<p>It is in this department that the packing and routing
		of advertising plates to newspapers or dealers is done.
		A system of triple checking each item of all orders
		precludes, as far as is humanly possible, any error in
		filling accurately all specifications.</p>
